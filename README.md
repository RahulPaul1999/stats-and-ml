# Awesome Statistics & Machine Learning

![Statistical Computing](biv_3-600x459.png)

- Materials about mathematical statistics, statistical computing, Bayesian statistics, multivariate statistics, and many other sub-fields of this beautiful discipline along with materials about machine learning.
- Each folder containts code I have written. This can range from simulations, implemenations of algorithms, and some data science examples.
- In addition, there is a file titled `references.md` that contains free references for statistics,mathematics, and machine learning. I try to add to this file as much as possible. 
- I take pull requests for anything in this repo as I see fit.

## Structure of Repo

- Bayesian Statistics
- Mathematical Statistics/Probability
- Multivariate Statistics
- Statistical Computing

## Software
- Currently, all implementations and scripts are in R.
