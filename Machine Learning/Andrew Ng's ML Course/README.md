- This folder contains the work I did for [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course at Stanford](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
- Here is a link to Andrew Ng's [CS 229: Machine Learning course at Stanford](http://cs229.stanford.edu/) for a more detailed look at the course.

## Reference Materials
- Each sub-folder having the title of an algorithm has a `.pdf` file, which goes over the exercise and algorithm used.
- This folder also contains a [brief Matlab tutorial](https://github.com/navdeep-G/awesome-statistics-ml/tree/master/Machine%20Learning/Andrew%20Ng's%20ML%20Course/Matlab%20Tutorial) for those not familiar with the language.
